# Git Identity 
## By [nefari0uss](https://www.github.com/nefari0uss)


## Summary
An easy way to switch between git profiles/identities without having to type `git config --local user.name` and `git config --local user.email` (and potentially have to run it again depending on whether you have a signing key or not).

I frequently switch between multiple identities - my online alias, personal identity, professional identity, and client identity. Yet every time, without fail, I forget to do so until after I've committed something. Then I have to go and run the `git config --local` commands to change the `user.name` and `user.email`. And then I try to commit again only to realize I have the wrong damned signing key in my gitconfig. Then I realize I don't remember the ID for the key. Then I realize I don't remember the stupid GPG commands. Then I...OK I'm just really forgetful and it's really all my fault. This is meant to simplify things.
